CLICKABLE CUBES TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
========================================

I've added a diagnostic tool to help identify issues!

STEP 1: RUN DIAGNOSTIC TEST
---------------------------

1. Enter Play Mode
2. Click anywhere in the Game view
3. Check Console for diagnostic output:

Expected Output:
   ✓ Camera: Main Camera
   ✓ Ray Origin: (x, y, z)
   ✓ Ray Direction: (x, y, z)
   ✓ HIT OBJECT: A1 (or whichever cube)
   ✓ Has ClickableCube component!
   ✓ BoxCollider enabled: True

COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
-------------------------

ISSUE 1: "Raycast hit nothing!"
   Problem: Camera can't see the cubes
   Solutions:
   ✓ Adjust Scene camera to see GridRoot in Scene view
   ✓ Check GridRoot is active (checkbox enabled)
   ✓ Position camera to face the grid
   ✓ GridRoot might be behind camera

ISSUE 2: "NO ClickableCube component"
   Problem: Component missing from cube
   Solutions:
   ✓ Select GridClickManager
   ✓ Right-click component → "Setup All Cubes"
   ✓ Or I can add them programmatically

ISSUE 3: Objects spawn but wrong size/position
   Problem: Scale or offset incorrect
   Solutions:
   ✓ Check ExampleSpawnObject prefab scale (should be 0.018)
   ✓ Check ClickableCube spawn offset (should be 0.01)
   ✓ Verify spawn scale = 1

ISSUE 4: Click detected but nothing happens
   Problem: ARTouchHandler not triggering ClickableCube
   Solutions:
   ✓ Verify ARTouchHandler has Main Camera assigned
   ✓ Check ARTouchHandler is enabled
   ✓ Ensure ClickableCube script has no errors

ISSUE 5: Works in Editor but not on device
   Problem: AR-specific setup needed
   Solutions:
   ✓ ARTouchHandler uses different input for device
   ✓ Ensure GridRoot is child of tracked image
   ✓ Grid must be visible in AR to be clickable

MANUAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
-----------------------------

□ ARTouchHandler exists in scene
□ ARTouchHandler has Main Camera assigned
□ GridClickManager exists in scene
□ GridClickManager has GridRoot assigned
□ GridClickManager has ExampleSpawnObject assigned
□ All 25 cubes have ClickableCube component
□ All cubes have BoxCollider component
□ ExampleSpawnObject prefab scale = 0.018
□ Spawn offset = (0, 0.01, 0)
□ GridRoot is active and visible
□ No console errors

QUICK FIXES
-----------

Fix 1: Reset Everything
   1. Select all cubes (A1-E5)
   2. Remove ClickableCube component
   3. Select GridClickManager
   4. Right-click → "Setup All Cubes"

Fix 2: Test Single Cube
   1. Select cube A1
   2. Manually click to test
   3. Watch Console for errors
   4. Should spawn sphere

Fix 3: Verify Camera View
   1. Select Main Camera
   2. GameObject menu → Align View to Selected
   3. Check if cubes are visible

DIAGNOSTIC TOOL USAGE
---------------------

The ClickDiagnostic GameObject provides detailed info:

In Play Mode:
   - Click anywhere
   - Console shows full raycast details
   - Identifies what was hit
   - Shows if ClickableCube exists

Remove when done:
   - Delete ClickDiagnostic GameObject
   - Or disable component

TESTING STEPS
-------------

Test 1: Editor Click (Mouse)
   1. Play Mode
   2. Click cube in Game view
   3. Should see sphere spawn
   4. Cube turns green

Test 2: AR Device (Touch)
   1. Build to device
   2. Scan QR/image target
   3. Grid appears in AR
   4. Tap cube on screen
   5. Sphere appears

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN
-----------------

When you click a cube:

1. ARTouchHandler detects click
2. Raycasts from camera through click point
3. Hits cube's BoxCollider
4. Finds ClickableCube component
5. Calls OnCubeClicked()
6. Spawns ExampleSpawnObject
7. Positions it 0.01 units above cube
8. Cube material turns green
9. Console logs success message

CURRENT SETUP STATUS
-------------------

Your scene has:
✓ ARTouchHandler (configured)
✓ GridClickManager (configured)
✓ 25 cubes with ClickableCube
✓ BoxColliders on all cubes
✓ ExampleSpawnObject prefab (scaled to 0.018)
✓ Spawn offset optimized (0.01)

If it's still not working, please tell me:
1. What happens when you click?
2. What error messages appear?
3. Does diagnostic show anything?
4. Are you testing in Editor or on device?
