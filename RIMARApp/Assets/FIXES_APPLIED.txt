ISSUES FIXED - CLICKABLE CUBES
========================================

ISSUE 1: HUGE SPAWN OBJECTS
---------------------------
Problem:
   - ExampleSpawnObject appeared huge (1.0 scale)
   - Even though prefab was scaled to 0.018

Root Cause:
   - ClickableCube.cs line 86 was overriding prefab scale
   - Code: spawnedObject.transform.localScale = Vector3.one * spawnScale
   - This set scale to 1.0 regardless of prefab's actual scale

Fix Applied:
   ✓ Modified SpawnObject() method in ClickableCube.cs
   ✓ Now respects the prefab's original scale
   ✓ Only applies spawnScale if different from 1.0
   ✓ Objects will now spawn at 0.018 scale (small, fits in cube)

ISSUE 2: DOUBLE GRID
-------------------
Possible Causes:
   
   1. Spawned Objects From Previous Tests
      - Old spawned spheres still in scene
      - Looks like duplicate grid
      Solution: Use cleanup tool (see below)

   2. Visual Artifact
      - Scene view vs Game view confusion
      - Camera seeing grid from wrong angle
      Solution: Position camera properly

   3. Duplicate GameObjects
      - Checked: Only 25 cubes exist ✓
      - No duplicates found

How to Clean Up:
   1. Select GridClickManager in Hierarchy
   2. Find "Cleanup Spawned Objects" component
   3. Right-click → "Clear All Spawned Objects"
   4. This removes all spawned objects and resets cubes

VERIFICATION STEPS
-----------------

Test the Fixes:

1. Exit Play Mode (if running)
2. Clean up old objects:
   - Select GridClickManager
   - Right-click "Cleanup Spawned Objects" component
   - Click "Clear All Spawned Objects"

3. Enter Play Mode

4. Click a cube

5. Expected Result:
   ✓ Small sphere appears (0.018 units)
   ✓ Sits neatly on cube surface
   ✓ Just 1cm above cube
   ✓ Fits within cube boundaries
   ✓ Cube turns green

6. Check Console:
   Should see: "Spawned ExampleSpawnObject_SpawnedBy_A1 at position..."

CURRENT SIZES
-------------

Cube:              0.025 x 0.001 x 0.025 units
                   (2.5cm x 0.1cm x 2.5cm)

Spawned Sphere:    0.018 units diameter
                   (1.8cm diameter)

Spawn Height:      0.01 units above cube
                   (1cm above surface)

Visual:
        ___
       ( o )  ← Sphere 0.018
       ‾‾‾
    ┌─────────┐
    │  Cube   │ ← Surface 0.025 x 0.025
    └─────────┘

Perfect fit! 72% of cube width.

TOOLS AVAILABLE
---------------

1. Cleanup Tool (NEW!)
   - Select: GridClickManager
   - Right-click component
   - "Clear All Spawned Objects" - Removes all spawned items
   - "List All Objects In Scene" - Shows all objects

2. Diagnostic Tool
   - Select: ClickDiagnostic
   - Enter Play Mode
   - Click anywhere
   - Console shows detailed raycast info

3. Grid Setup Tool
   - Select: GridClickManager
   - Right-click "Grid Click Setup"
   - "Setup All Cubes" - Add ClickableCube to all
   - "Reset All Cubes" - Clear spawns, reset colors

WHAT CHANGED IN CODE
--------------------

File: /Assets/Scripts/ClickableCube.cs
Method: SpawnObject()

OLD CODE (Line 86):
   spawnedObject.transform.localScale = Vector3.one * spawnScale;
   ↓
   Always set scale to 1.0 * spawnScale
   Ignored prefab's actual scale

NEW CODE:
   if (spawnScale != 1f)
   {
       spawnedObject.transform.localScale = objectToSpawn.transform.localScale * spawnScale;
   }
   ↓
   Keeps prefab scale by default
   Only applies multiplier if spawnScale ≠ 1.0
   Respects prefab's 0.018 scale

TESTING CHECKLIST
----------------

Before Testing:
□ Exit Play Mode
□ Clean up spawned objects
□ Save scene

Test in Editor:
□ Enter Play Mode
□ Click cube A1
□ Sphere appears small (0.018)
□ Sphere on cube surface
□ Cube turns green
□ Console shows success

If Still Issues:
□ Check Console for errors
□ Use diagnostic tool (click anywhere)
□ Verify camera can see grid
□ Check GridRoot is active

SUMMARY
-------

✓ Fixed huge spawn objects
✓ Added cleanup tool
✓ Verified no duplicate cubes
✓ Objects now spawn at correct size (0.018)
✓ Objects positioned neatly on cube (0.01 above)

Your clickable cubes should work perfectly now!
